Implementation Notes for 'Bending Light' sim

This repository contains the code for three simulations: Intro, Prisms, and More Tools.

Source code directory structure is as follows:
common - contains code that is used by >1 screen intro - contains code used by the "intro" screen prisms - contains code
used by "prisms" screen more-tools - contains code used by "more tools" screen

Each of the above directories is further divided into model and view packages. Model and view of the intro and prisms
screens extends BendingLightModel and BendingLightView of the common directory respectively. More Tools screen is the
extension of Intro screen.

Model-view transforms are used in the simulation to map between model and view coordinate frames. The default origin for
model is at the center of the screen with variable horizontal and vertical offset that can be defined in each screen. In
model positive x is to the right, positive y is up. In view the default origin is at (0,0) and positive x is to the
right, positive y is down.

The components laser, tools, light rays, prisms in the simulation are attached to different layers.

```
mediumNode
beforeLightLayer2
beforeLightLayer
singleColorLightNode
afterLightLayer
laserViewLayer
afterLightLayer2
```

All these layers are defined and added in the BendingLightView. All the rays in sim are represented as a webGL node with
a canvas fallback. The detection for webGL/canvas is handled by the code. Canvas fallback for white light is bounded to
dev bounds to overcome performance issues. Dragging of the tools, laser and prisms is restricted to dev bounds.

Properties are named with the suffix 'Property', e.g. positionProperty.
